# venus

## Description

Since childhood, I have been interested in space as well as astronomy and astrophysics, and maybe that's why I
decided to create a page dedicated to one of the Solar System planets. May be after visiting this site you will be
inspired and want to learn more?

The page consists of groups of blocks with facts about Venus and its images. There is a preloader on the page that
disappears after all resources are fully loaded, and I also used Swiper as a slider for the images.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm ci
```

## Commands

``npm run dev`` - start Gulp with dev-server and watching

``npm run build`` - build project with minified files

``npm run deploy`` - build project and deploy to GitHub Pages
